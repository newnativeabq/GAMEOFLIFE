# Game of Life

Written in Golang to force myself to finally try the language out (and because I wanted a reasonably performant game)


## Setup

### Requirements (Fedora)

```bash
sudo dnf install golang
```


```bash
sudo dnf install mesa-libGLU-devel mesa-libGLES-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel libXi-devel alsa-lib-devel pkg-config
```
